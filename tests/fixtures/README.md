# Test fixtures

Captured HTML from [incidecoder.com](https://incidecoder.com/) used by the
offline test suite (`npm test`). These files let the parser tests run offline
and deterministically, and double as a tripwire when the site's markup changes.

## Attribution & copyright

The HTML in this directory is reproduced from incidecoder.com. All rights in the
source content — including product descriptions, ingredient writeups, brand
names, and page markup — belong to INCIDecoder (`hello@incidecoder.com`). The
content is reproduced here **solely for non-distributed, development-time test
fixtures** and is **not** shipped in the published package (the `files` field
in `package.json` whitelists only `dist/`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and
`LICENSE`).

If you are INCIDecoder's operator and would prefer these fixtures removed,
open an issue at <https://github.com/knorby/incidecoder-client/issues> and they
will be taken down.

## How they were captured

Via `node scripts/capture-fixtures.mjs`, which `GET`s each URL below with a
`User-Agent` of
`@knorby/incidecoder-client/0 (capture-fixtures; +https://github.com/knorby/incidecoder-client)`
and a 750 ms pause between requests (polite scraping). Re-run that script to
refresh the fixtures, then update expected assertions in the `*.test.ts` files
if the site's markup has changed.
